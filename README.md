# LLD

This is a repository containing famous Low Level Designs.
I have created this mainly for my practice, but feel free
to take reference and suggest modifications.

## How to view?
1. All the files in the Design Patterns are executable
2. Take a clone of the repo
3. Open it in an IDE
4. Run the Java File for the Design Pattern you would like

## Design Patterns
### Creational
<b>Idea:</b> Deal with object creation
- [Factory](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Factory.java)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Creational/Observer.java)
- [AbstractFactory](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Creational/AbstractFactory.java)
- [Builder](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Creational/Builder.java)
### Structural
<b>Idea:</b> Deal with object composition and relationships
- [Decorator](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Structural/Decorator.java)
- [Adapter](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Structural/Adapter.java)
- [Facade](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Structural/Facade.java)
### Behavioral
<b>Idea:</b> Deal with object interaction and responsibility
- [Observer](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/Observer.java)
- [State](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/State.java)
- [Strategy](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/Strategy.java)
- [ChainOfResponsibility](https://github.com/heisastark/LLD/blob/main/src/DesignPatterns/Behavioral/ChainOfResponsibility.java)
